## How the game works

The player may choose one of Rock, Paper, or Scissors.  The computer also selects one of these options.

* Rock crushes Scissors.
* Scissors cut Paper.
* Paper covers Rock.

The history of round outcomes are kept track of, as well as the overall player and computer scores.  The player may reset the scores and game history.
