# React vs. Vue

## Goal
The goal of this independent study is to build a simple React application and draw comparisons to Vue.  One purpose of this is to better understand Single Page Applications from a broad perspective.  I also benefit from learning some React as it is being used by several neighboring teams at my company.

## Approach
The approach I've decided to take is to follow the [Tutorial: Intro to React](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html), which involves building a Tic-Tac-Toe game in React.  Through building this application, I anticipate I will encounter similar terminology and concepts to the ones we've learned in the e28 course.  I will make note of notable similarities and differences and write down my conclusions.  I will also supplement my learning by reading  online blogs and discussions that compare the two frameworks and report on what I find.
