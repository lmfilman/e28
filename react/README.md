# React vs. Vue

## Goal
The goal of this independent study is to build a simple React application and draw comparisons to Vue.  One purpose of this is to better understand Single Page Applications from a broad perspective.  I also benefit from learning some React as it is being used by several neighboring teams at my company.

## Approach
The approach I've decided to take is to follow the [Tutorial: Intro to React](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html), which involves building a Tic-Tac-Toe game in React.  Through building this application, I anticipate I will encounter similar terminology and concepts to the ones we've learned in the e28 course.  I will make note of notable similarities and differences and write down my conclusions.  I will also supplement my learning by reading  online blogs and discussions that compare the two frameworks and report on what I find.

## Building Tic-Tac-Toe
### Step 1: Setup local development environment

1. In order to run the tutorial in a local development environment, we are first instructed to install a recent version of Node (>=8.10) and npm (>=5.6).  We have already done this in [e28 - week 8](https://hesweb.dev/e28/notes/vue/package-management#install-npm).

2. Use the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) tool which bootstraps a new React app with the following command:
```
npx create-react-app my-app
```
The command generates a template React application and installs dependencies.

3. Start the template application
```
cd my-app
npm start
```
We can now visit http://localhost:3000/ and see the following in our browser:
